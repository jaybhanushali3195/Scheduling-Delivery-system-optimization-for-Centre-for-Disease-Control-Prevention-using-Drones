# Scheduling & Delivery system optimization for Centre for Disease Control & Prevention using Drones
  <p> • Build Mathematical models for Drone Scheduling, Vehicle Routing minimizing transportation costs using Subtour elimination constraints.
   <p> • Mixed Integer Problems were then solved using Pulp package & CPLEX followed by Dynamic programming for getting Upper Bound. 
   <p> • Scheduling costs were reduced by 33% & transportation costs by 16% and Greedy Heuristics used to Verify the results.
